# ADAppRater-UWP open source governance

Our governance model is as follows:

* There is a single Tech Lead, who will have the final say on all decisions regarding technical direction.
* The Tech Lead directs the Core Committers, whose members include the Tech Lead and those who have been appointed by the Tech Lead as Core Committers.
* In the event the Tech Lead is unable to perform his or her duties, or abdicates, the Core Committers can select a new Tech Lead from amongst themselves.
* In the event there are no Core Committers, Autodesk Inc. will appoint one.

## Core Committers:

* Tech Lead: Zhang Minqi (@zmq2017)
